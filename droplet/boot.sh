# **THE PROBES, BOOTED THE WAY A DROPLET BOOTS THEM.** Each one is put on a
# disk with the boot loader and checked as a GPT disk (image.sh), and the
# droplet-shaped QEMU starts it from its BIOS. A probe passes when it prints PASS and leaves through the door
# with 0.
#
#   droplet/boot.sh          every probe below
#   droplet/boot.sh clock    just one
#
# **EVERY BOOT STARTS ON DIRTY RAM** (droplet.sh's DIRTY=1): a machine that
# hands over zeroed memory hides a loader that forgot to zero it.
#
# `memory` boots at three sizes, because the memory map is the one thing the
# loader builds from what the BIOS says, and 4 GB is where the map gets a hole
# in it (the PCI window, under 4 GB) and a region above it. `block` and `net`
# find their devices on the PCI bus, as on a droplet; `block` writes the disk's
# last sector, which on this image is the backup GPT header, so it runs after
# sgdisk has looked. `rng` finds no virtio-rng, because a droplet has none,
# and draws from RDRAND alone.
