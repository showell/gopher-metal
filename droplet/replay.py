"""Real traffic as the judge's input (QUEUE.md item 48): the GETs in a Caddy
access log, asked again of two hosts serving the same data, and compared.

    droplet/replay.py LOG A_URL B_URL [--host lynrummy.com] [--netns NAME] [--unique]
    droplet/replay.py --self-test ZIG_SERVER_BINARY

`LOG` is Caddy's access log, one JSON object a line (`log { format json }`;
`format` is JSON by default). **PROD WRITES NONE TODAY:** its Caddyfile has
no `log` directive (REVIEW-admin-backup.md), so one has to be added there
before there is anything to replay.

**KEPT:** a request whose `request.method` is GET and whose
`request.headers` holds no `Cookie` and no `Authorization`, whatever their
value (Caddy writes `REDACTED` in place of a credential, so it is never
here to send). With `--host`, only that `request.host`. Left out, and
counted by why:
- anything carrying a credential, and anything that is not a GET;
- a stream (`Accept: text/event-stream`, or a path ending `/stream`),
  which does not end;
- `/version` and `/admin/host`, which describe each host and differ by
  design, as compare_hosts.py leaves them out;
- a line that is not a Caddy request.
With `--unique`, a target asked once already is not asked again.

Each kept request is asked of A and then of B, in the log's order, with
no cookie, redirects not followed. They are compared by status and by the
SHA-256 of the body. With `--netns NAME`, B is asked through `ip netns exec
NAME`, as the box reaches metal's private card.

**IT PRINTS COUNTS AND ANONYMISED LABELS ONLY.** A target can hold a
topic's or a person's name, so a difference is named by its line in the
log, its first path segment, and the start of its target's SHA-256:
`line 812, /chat/... (#3fa9c1d2)`. The operator finds it in the log with
the line number.

**A GET WITH NO CREDENTIAL WRITES NOTHING** on angry-gopher from item 52
on (a puzzle session is made by its first move). The one GET that writes,
re-signing a legacy `gopher_uid` (item 51), needs a cookie, so it is never
kept. Replaying is read-only on both hosts.

Exit status: 0 when every kept request answered alike, 1 when any
differed, 2 for a usage error.
