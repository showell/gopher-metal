# **A BACKUP OF METAL, BY HAND, ON PROD** (QUEUE.md item 98; CUTOVER.md's
# "Backups, after the cutover"). Run on <prod>, over the private network, where
# metal answers nothing else while it streams (REVIEW-admin-backup.md finding 3):
#
#   droplet/backup.sh HOST [DIR]
#
# HOST  where metal answers on the private network, e.g. http://10.100.0.4
# DIR   where the encrypted backups are kept (default ./gopher-backups)
#
# It asks for the admin password (twice over the wire: to log in, then for the
# archive), fetches /admin/backup, checks it is whole (check_backup.py), encrypts
# it with a passphrase it also asks for (`age -p`), keeps the newest few and
# shreds the rest, and **never leaves a plaintext tar behind, even on failure** —
# a trap shreds it whatever happens. The passwords are read with `read -rs` and
# handed to curl on stdin, so neither is ever in argv or the environment.
#
# It needs: curl, age, shred, python3 (for check_backup.py). The admin name
# defaults to Steve (`GOPHER_ADMIN` to change it); KEEP is how many to keep.
