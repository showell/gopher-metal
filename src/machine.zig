//! **A STATE THAT CHANGES ONLY BY A NAMED EVENT** (metal-vmm STATE_TRACKING.md,
//! QUEUE item 140). A machine declares its states, its events and the edges
//! between them; code reads the state freely and changes it only by `fire`,
//! which looks the next state up. Nothing chooses a state but the table.
//!
//! **EVERY CELL IS A COVERAGE SITE.** `fire` is one `switch` over every
//! (state, event) pair, each prong compiled with its own message, so the
//! catalog holds one site per cell:
//! - an edge is a `reachable`: a sweep that never took it reports it unhit,
//!   a legal transition no test drives;
//! - a pair with no edge is an `unreachable`: reached, it breaks, and a unit
//!   test fails at it (`on_broken`). The state is left as it was.
//!
//! The messages are regular, so a reader greps them:
//! `machine tcp.Fin: sent --timed_out--> resending` and
//! `machine tcp.Fin: nothing leaves acknowledged on timed_out`.
//!
//! **BUILT TO MOVE** (the box's vote: local first, promoted on its second
//! user): it imports nothing of gopher-metal's, only the coverage SDK, and
//! makes its sites the way the SDK makes them. Moving it is a file and an
//! import.
//!
//! **ONLY `fire` WRITES THE STATE.** `machine_state` is a field, since Zig
//! has none private; `tools/lint_machine.py` refuses an assignment to it
//! anywhere else, and `startingAt` (a machine made at a given state) outside
//! a test.
