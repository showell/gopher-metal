//! **A FULL SERIAL PORT IS WAITED FOR, BRIEFLY, AND THEN SKIPPED UNTIL IT
//! DRAINS** (QUEUE.md item 41). The pure half of `serial.putPort`,
//! host-tested with a port that is full when a test says so.
//!
//! A droplet's serial port goes to DigitalOcean, and a test's goes to a QEMU
//! that may be slow to drain it; a port nobody drains must not hang the
//! machine. So a byte waits `patience` reads of the line status at most.
//!
//! It used to give the port up for the rest of the boot after one such wait,
//! without a word: a reader of the port saw the log stop mid-boot while the
//! machine carried on (README, "one boot printed its first line and then
//! nothing", 1 of 27). Now a port given up on is tried again, once, at the
//! start of each later write: one status read, no waiting. When it takes
//! bytes again, the first thing it is sent is how many were dropped, so the
//! gap is visible where it happened.
