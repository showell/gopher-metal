//! The kernel's one stack, and the telemetry that says how much of it is used.
//!
//! **16 MB, because that is what the same code got on Linux.** angry-gopher
//! serves each request on a thread from `std.Thread`'s pool, and
//! `SpawnConfig.default_stack_size` is 16 MB. This machine runs the same route
//! table over the same std library with no threads at all — but the frames are
//! the frames, and the deepest one is as deep here as there. This stack was
//! 64 KB, a 250x shortfall, and `/chat/recent` triple-faulted the machine:
//! the fault handler has no stack either, so the third fault is a reset with
//! nothing in the log.
//!
//! **PAINTED, SO THE DEPTH IS MEASURED RATHER THAN HOPED FOR.** The boot stub
//! fills the whole region with `paint` before it sets `rsp`. Afterwards the
//! lowest word that is no longer `paint` is the high-water mark: everything
//! below it has never been touched by any call this boot. That is a
//! measurement of the real route table on the real requests, not an estimate.
//!
//! **AND THE BOTTOM IS A GUARD.** If the lowest `guard` bytes have been
//! written, a frame came within that much of running off the end — and off the
//! end is `.bss`, where the heaps and the device rings live, so the corruption
//! would be silent and arbitrary. A breached guard stops the machine.
//!
//! One blind spot, stated: a stack word that legitimately holds `paint` reads
//! as untouched, so the mark can only ever come out *shallower* than the truth,
//! never deeper. 0xA5A5… is not a plausible pointer, length or ASCII.
