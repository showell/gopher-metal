//! **WHAT A DISK NEEDS BEFORE OUTPUT LEAVES THE MACHINE** (metal-vmm QUEUE
//! item 59): the decision `virtio.Block.flush` makes, pulled out of the I/O
//! it does, so `durable_sim.zig` can drive it over any interleaving of
//! writes, responses and flush outcomes. The I/O stays behind in `Block`:
//! `scsi.synchronize` is called only when `step` says so.
//!
//! The rule it serves (`io.durable`): nothing joins a send queue while a
//! write before it is unflushed. `Stream.sendAll` and `serviceStreams` call
//! `io.durable` before they queue a byte, and `io.durable` asks each disk's
//! `Block.flush`, which asks `step` here.
