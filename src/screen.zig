//! **THE SCREEN, FOR A MACHINE WHOSE ONLY WINDOW IS ITS SCREEN.** A droplet's
//! serial port goes nowhere anyone can read; DigitalOcean's recovery console
//! shows the screen. So everything the console says is also written here.
//!
//! After the BIOS, a PC's screen is in text mode 3: 80 columns by 25 rows,
//! two bytes a character (the character, then its colours), in text memory
//! from physical 0xB8000. The boot loader printed through the BIOS, and the
//! BIOS keeps its cursor in its data area (column at 0x450, row at 0x451), so
//! this carries on below the loader's lines rather than over them.
//!
//! **IT SCROLLS BY MOVING THE WINDOW, NOT THE TEXT.** On a virtual machine
//! every access to text memory is a trip out to the hypervisor. Scrolling by
//! copying 24 rows up is about 4,000 of them per line, and the chat server
//! logs after every request: on the droplet-shaped QEMU a request took 250 ms
//! with the screen and 6.4 ms without (2026-10-01). Text memory holds 32 KB,
//! about 200 rows, of which the display controller shows the 25 starting at
//! its start address (CRTC registers 0x0C/0x0D). So a new line is written into
//! the next row down and the start address moved one row: one row of writes
//! and two port writes. Only when the window reaches the end of text memory
//! are the visible rows copied back to the top, once in about 175 lines.
//!
//! **ONLY A MACHINE THAT HAS A SCREEN IS WRITTEN TO.** On QEMU's microvm or
//! metal-vmm, 0xB8000 may be ordinary memory, and text written there would
//! land in whatever the page allocator handed out. `attach` turns the screen
//! on only when the PCI bus lists a display controller (class 03), which a
//! droplet does in slot 02.
