//! **NOTHING LEAVES AHEAD OF THE WRITES BEFORE IT, UNDER A SEED** (metal-vmm
//! QUEUE.md item 59). `durable.zig` is the decision `virtio.Block.flush`
//! makes; this drives it as `io.durable` does, over every interleaving a
//! seed draws, against what each disk truly does.
//!
//! Each run is one seed. It chooses two disks: each a SCSI disk or a
//! virtio-blk one, and for a SCSI disk what it truly is (a write cache, said
//! or not said; no cache, said, or not said until SYNCHRONIZE CACHE answers
//! ILLEGAL REQUEST; or a cache that says it writes through). Then events:
//!
//! - **a write** to a disk;
//! - **a response** (`Stream.sendAll`) or **a stream turn**
//!   (`serviceStreams`): `io.durable` over both disks, then output that
//!   says everything written so far;
//! - **bytes kept in a spill** (`sendAll`, the queue full): `io.durable`,
//!   and the bytes wait; **a spill pushed** (`Spill.push`): they join the
//!   queue later with no flush, as its comment defends;
//!   and each SYNCHRONIZE CACHE answered good, failed, or ILLEGAL REQUEST.
//!
//! **THE ORACLES**, from what the disks truly kept, not from the decision:
//!
//! - output that says a write was saved goes out only once that write is
//!   truly durable, but where a flush for its disk failed just before (the
//!   case `io.durable` defends: logged, counted, and the response goes out)
//!   or the disk lied about its cache (believed, as `step` says);
//! - a spill's bytes, pushed after later writes, said only what was durable
//!   when they were kept;
//! - no SYNCHRONIZE CACHE is sent with nothing written since the last good
//!   one, nor to a disk that cannot be asked;
//! - after a failed one, the next output sends one again.
