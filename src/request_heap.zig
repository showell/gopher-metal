//! **THE HEAP ONE REQUEST GETS**, and gives back whole when it is answered —
//! the machine's equivalent of the arena `server.zig` hands each request on
//! Linux and frees in one go.
//!
//! It is an arena over the machine's pages, with two things added:
//!
//!   - **A size it keeps.** After every request it shrinks back to `keep`
//!     bytes, so the usual request never asks the page heap for anything, and
//!     an unusual one — a ten megabyte image on its way to disk — does not
//!     leave ten megabytes reserved for the rest of the boot.
//!   - **What the request asked for**, exactly, in bytes. The machine prints
//!     it after every request, and the judge requires the same request to use
//!     the same amount every time: a figure that drifts is a handler keeping
//!     something it should not, and a figure that does not drift is the
//!     strongest statement this machine can make about its memory.
//!
//! **WHY GROWABLE.** A fixed heap makes the largest request the machine can
//! answer a number chosen at build time, and the answer past it is not the
//! answer Linux gives: an upload bigger than the heap failed while it was
//! being read, which is "400, could not read the body" instead of "413, the
//! limit is 10 MB" — and, for a big enough one, the connection closing while
//! the client was still sending.
