# Mutation testing of the pure layers

*metal-vmm QUEUE items 93 and 95 (CC, 2026-10-07).* Coverage says a line
**ran**. This file says whether anything would have **noticed** if that line
were wrong. One small bug was planted at a time in `tcp`, `durable`, `ready`,
the Store, `log_ring`, `page_cache` and `fat16`. Each one was run against
`zig build test`, and if that passed, against `zig build properties` at a
reduced size (`-Dsweep-optimize=ReleaseSafe -Dseeds=30 -Dfat-seeds=8
-Dpage-seeds=40 -Dpure-seeds=60 -Dfull-seeds=4 -Dfloor-seeds=200
-Dstore-seeds=200 -Ddurable-seeds=200 -Dready-seeds=100`). The file was
restored after each run, and no mutant was committed anywhere.

The mutants were planted on gopher-metal `a9163f2`. Of the files mutated,
only `fat16.zig` has changed on `master` since (v19, `c481c5e`, folders held
in memory), and every fat16 survivor's line is still there unchanged.

## The score

| module | planted | killed when planted | killed now | survivors equivalent | score (killed / planted) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tcp | 17 | 10 | 12 | 2 (T1, T7) | 12 / 17 |
| durable | 7 | 7 | 7 | 0 | 7 / 7 |
| ready | 10 | 9 | 10 | 0 | 10 / 10 |
| Store (`store`, `store_fat`) | 11 | 7 | 8 | 0 | 8 / 11 |
| log_ring | 11 | 8 | 8 | 2 (L6, L10) | 8 / 11 |
| page_cache | 13 | 10 | 10 | 0 | 10 / 13 |
| fat16 | 16 | 8 | 12 | 4 (F2, F13; F4, F11 in effect) | 12 / 16 |
| **all** | **85** | **59** | **67** | **8** | **67 / 85** |

"Killed now" counts the eight survivors that later got an oracle: T14, T16,
R6 and S2 (item 93), and F6, F10, F14 and F15 (fat16_test, item 107, the
tests named in the tables below, each re-planted and killed). Leaving out
the eight equivalent mutants, which no oracle could kill, the score is 67 of
77, and fat16's is 12 of 12.

What the run itself shows:

- **Every kill came from `zig build test`.** No mutant that survived the
  tests was caught by the reduced properties sweep. The sweep's value is in
  its range, which needs a run to reach a state first, and that is what the
  explorer (item 95) is for.
- **The simulators earn their place.** Of the 59 kills when planted, 25
  came from a simulator's handful of seeds (`tcp_sim`, `ready_sim`,
  `store_sim`, `page_sim`, `pure_sim`, `fat_sim`, `floor_sim`) or from a
  model comparison (`store_test`, `io_test`), not from a unit test.
- **The weak places are timers and accounting that nothing outside reads
  back**, not the parsers. They are: Karn's rule (T14, now checked); what is
  left on the disk past a file's end (F6); a temporary file left behind
  (S6); whether a deleted directory entry is reused (F15); and whether
  `queue` takes all the room it has (T6).
- **Two Store mutants as first written did not compile** (zig refuses an
  unused local or parameter). S8 and S11 were rewritten (`and false` added)
  and run again. The table shows the rewritten forms.

## Every mutant

| # | where | original | mutant | verdict | by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | src/tcp.zig:279 | `self.start > self.rx.len / 2` | `self.start >= self.rx.len / 2` | survived | see below |
| T2 | src/tcp.zig:332 | `off < @max(self.window(), 1)` | `off <= @max(self.window(), 1)` | killed | `tcp_test`: a reset at the window's right edge is outside it, and is ignored |
| T3 | src/tcp.zig:349 | `return @as(usize, w) < @min` | `return @as(usize, w) <= @min` | survived | see below |
| T4 | src/tcp.zig:516 | `now - c.opened_at < min_rto_ns` | `now - c.opened_at <= 0` | killed | `tcp_test`: a SYN flood does not keep a real client out: the oldest half-open connection gives way |
| T5 | src/tcp.zig:517 | `c.opened_at < self.conns[oldest.?].opened_at` | `c.opened_at > self.conns[oldest.?].opened_at` | killed | `tcp_sim`: revival: item 24's seeds, rough and crowded, pass; with the ring off, each fails as before |
| T6 | src/tcp.zig:668 | ` and c.tx_start > 0)` | ` and c.tx_start > 1)` | survived | see below |
| T7 | src/tcp.zig:784 | `if (c.wnd > c.sent)` | `if (c.wnd >= c.sent + 1)` | survived | see below |
| T8 | src/tcp.zig:897 | `c.retries >= max_retries` | `c.retries > max_retries` | killed | `tcp_test`: a peer that never answers is reset after the last timeout |
| T9 | src/tcp.zig:885 | `(3 * c.rttvar_ns + off) / 4` | `(3 * c.rttvar_ns + off) / 3` | killed | `tcp_test`: the handshake is the first measurement, and the estimate is RFC 6298's |
| T10 | src/tcp.zig:921 | `advance > flight` | `advance >= flight` | killed | `tcp_test`: our FIN, then theirs acknowledging it, closes it and frees the slot |
| T11 | src/tcp.zig:944 | `if (!updated) c.wnd -= @min(c.wnd, advance);` | `if (false) c.wnd -= @min(c.wnd, advance);` | killed | `tcp_test`: an older segment with a newer acknowledgement moves the window's edge too |
| T12 | src/tcp.zig:945 | `advance > bytes` | `advance >= bytes` | killed | `tcp_test`: only what the window allows goes out, and an acknowledgement lets more go |
| T13 | src/tcp.zig:840 | `c.updates >= max_retries` | `c.updates > max_retries` | killed | `tcp_test`: a peer with nothing more to say is told a bounded number of times |

| T17 | src/tcp.zig:1199 | `if (c.peer_done) return self.close(i);` | `if (false) return self.close(i);` | killed | `tcp_test`: their FIN repeated before we close is acknowledged again, and after, reset |
| D1 | src/durable.zig:49 | `if (!d.unflushed) return .none;` | `if (false) return .none;` | killed | `durable`: nothing written, nothing done; written through, cleared; cached or not said, synchronized |

| D3 | src/durable.zig:50 | `!d.asks or d.write_cache == false` | `!d.asks and d.write_cache == false` | killed | `store_test`: the model and the FAT store agree on every operation, and every error |
| D4 | src/durable.zig:65 | `d.unflushed = false;` | `d.unflushed = d.unflushed;` | killed | `io_test`: a write is flushed before the next response, once, and a read asks no flush |
| D5 | src/durable.zig:69 | `if (ok) d.unflushed = false else` | `if (true) d.unflushed = false else` | killed | `durable`: a failed synchronize leaves the disk unflushed, to be tried again |

## The survivors

Each survivor was diagnosed by a **difference probe**: the original line kept,
with `@panic` planted exactly where the mutant would have behaved
differently. The probe ran under `zig build test` and then under
`zig build properties` at **default** sizes (100 TCP seeds, 20 FAT, and so
on). There are three verdicts:

- **reached, unchecked**: a run gets to a state where the mutant differs, and
  nothing notices.
- **unreached**: no run gets to such a state.
- **equivalent**: no state makes the mutant differ, or the difference is
  only in speed.

| # | verdict | why it survived | what would catch it | whose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | equivalent | Compacting the receive buffer at exactly half instead of past half moves the same bytes. | nothing can | none |
| T3 | unreached | `tight(w)` is never asked about a window of exactly `min(our_mss, rx.len / 2)`. | a `tcp_test` case at that window, or a `tcp_sim` peer that advertises exactly one MSS | box (`tcp_test`); `tcp_sim` side mine |
| T6 | reached, unchecked | With `tx_start == 1`, `queue` doesn't compact and takes less. 8 test runs reach it. Callers queue the rest later, so nothing differs on the wire. | `queue` takes `min(bytes, free room)`, checked in `tcp_sim`'s server when it queues | mine (`tcp_sim`) |
| T7 | equivalent | `wnd > sent` and `wnd >= sent + 1` agree for every u32 that can occur. | nothing can | none |
| T14 | reached, unchecked; **now killed** | Nothing checked that a resent segment is not timed (Karn). | `tcp_sim` reads every frame the table sends, `3c9fceb` | done |
| T15 | unreached | No run has sequence numbers exactly 2^31 apart. There the mutant makes `after(a, b)` and `after(b, a)` both true. | a `tcp_test` case: `after` is never true both ways | box (`tcp_test`) |
| T16 | unreached; **now killed** | No test had an option of length 1 before an MSS. | floor_sim `mssSeed`, `9745fd1` | done |
| R6 | reached, unchecked; **now killed** | Every chunked request ready_sim made had no Content-Length. | ready_sim: a chunked body that also gives a length, `1a3fbc4` | done |
| S2 | unreached; **now killed** | No test named a path with DEL (0x7F) in it. | the Store's path test, `051941b` | done |
| S5 | reached, unchecked | No disk in any test loses a write it hasn't flushed, so `replace` without its flush acts the same. 18 test runs reach it. | a disk that holds writes until a flush and drops them at a cut, under `store_sim`: after a cut, a replaced file is old or new, never torn | mine (`store_sim`, a test disk with a write cache) |
| S6 | reached, unchecked | When `replace`'s rename fails, the hidden temp file stays and its clusters leak. `list` hides it, and the model never counts clusters. 8 test runs reach it. | `store_sim`'s filling tier: free clusters after a failed `replace` equal those before it | mine (`store_sim`) |
| S11 | unreached | FAT never answers `NotFat16` to a write: no test or sweep writes under a path whose parent is a file, so that mapping's write branch never runs. | `store_test`: write `a/b` where `a` is a file, and expect `BadName` | mine (Store) |
| L6 | equivalent | When `from == piece.len`, the mutant copies 0 bytes and sets `from = 0`, which is what skipping the piece does. | nothing can | none |
| L7 | unreached | No line ends a quoted secret with a bare `\r` before its closing quote. There the mutant drops the `\r`, which over-redacts and does not leak. | floor_sim `redactSeed`: an unterminated quoted value ended by `\r\n`, and the `\r` comes out | mine (`floor_sim`) |
| L10 | equivalent | Every key is matched as contiguous bytes, and `\n` is not in any key, so a stale window before a newline can never match. | nothing can | none |
| P1 | unreached | `page_sim`'s over-long paths always have a prefix part, so `n + part.len` is never exactly `max_key + 1`. There the mutant writes `out[256]`, out of bounds. | `page_sim`: now and then a single part of exactly `max_key + 1` bytes | mine (`page_sim`) |
| P4 | reached, unchecked | When a growing copy is the last slot and an eviction moves it, the mutant loses track of it (8 test runs reach this). It survives because the copy is never also the oldest left, so it is never the next one evicted. | already there: `wrote`'s `self.find(key).?` panics, and `page_sim`'s model disagrees. **For the explorer.** | explorer |
| P5 | unreached | `page_sim`'s budgets are whole pages and sizes are rounded to pages, so `size == budget + 1` can't occur. | already there (`props.unreachable` "no room for a file within the budget"), once a budget can be one byte short of a page multiple | mine (`page_sim`'s budget) |
| F2 | equivalent | Looking once more at the first candidate, already found taken, changes nothing. | nothing can | none |
| F4 | equivalent in effect | When a write's run ends exactly at the end of its data, the mutant looks up one more cluster and then writes the same sectors. Unreached under the probe as well. | nothing can (one more FAT lookup) | none |
| F6 | reached, unchecked; **now killed** | A write that ends inside a new sector keeps whatever the disk held there instead of zeroing it. Bytes past the file's size are never read, so nothing notices. 150 test runs reach it. | `fat_sim`'s end of run: the bytes after each file's size in its last sector are zero | mine (`fat_sim`) |
| F10 | unreached; **now killed** | No caller reads at `offset == size`. The mutant then walks the chain to a cluster that may not exist and answers `BadChain` instead of 0. | floor_sim's `readAt` cases: at `offset == size`, with the size a whole number of clusters, expect 0 bytes | mine (`floor_sim`) |
| F11 | equivalent in effect | When a read's run ends exactly at what is wanted, the mutant follows one more link, and copies only what is wanted. | nothing can (one more FAT lookup) | none |
| F13 | equivalent | It detects a chain loop at twice the volume's cluster count instead of once. The error is the same, later. | nothing can | none |
| F14 | reached, unchecked; **now killed** | `check` misses a chain exactly one cluster short of its size. The tests that reach one (2 runs) accept `.short` but don't require it. | floor_sim `fatSeed`: a size exactly one cluster past the chain, and `check` must report `.short` | mine (`floor_sim`) |
| F15 | reached, unchecked; **now killed** | `findRun` never reuses a deleted (0xE5) entry, so a directory grows instead. On FAT16 the root fills sooner. Every outcome is still allowed, because a full directory is an accepted answer. | `fat_sim`: after a remove, a name needing no more entries than were freed fits without the directory growing | mine (`fat_sim`) |

### The fat16 survivors and the kernel

**None of the eight fat16 survivors shows a defect in kernel code.**

- **Four are equivalent** (F2, F13), or equivalent apart from speed (F4,
  F11): one more FAT lookup, or a loop detected later.
- **The other four were weak oracles**, and each now has the test that
  kills it in `fat16_test.zig` (metal-vmm QUEUE 107):
  - F6: no test checks what is on the disk past a file's end.
  - F10: no test reads at the very end of a file.
  - F14: no test checks the checker on a chain one cluster short.
  - F15: no test checks that deleted entries are reused.

Two of them come closest to mattering in production:

- **F6.** If `.zeros` ever stopped zeroing, an old file's bytes would sit on
  the disk past a new file's end. The kernel zeroes them today. Nothing
  would notice if it stopped.
- **F15.** If deleted entries stopped being reused, a FAT16 root that sees
  many deletes would hit `DirectoryFull` early. Again, the kernel is right
  today and nothing would notice if it changed.

The survivors whose natural test is a kernel unit test, and so the box's,
are both in **tcp**: T3 (`tight` at exactly one MSS) and T15 (`after` at
2^31). Both are unreached, and both are a one-line `tcp_test` case.

## For the explorer

*(Item 95.)* These are survivors where an **existing** oracle would fail if a
run reached the right state. Plant the patch, and see whether blind seeds or
the explorer gets there first.

1. **P4: a growing copy loses track of itself after an eviction.** The state
   has three parts: a `wrote` that grows the copy in the **last** slot, an
   eviction that moves it, and then a second eviction that needs room and
   finds it the oldest left. The tests already reach the first two (8 runs).
   The third is the rare one. `wrote`'s `self.find(key).?` panics, or
   `page_sim`'s model sees the copy gone. The patch:
   ```diff
   --- a/src/page_cache.zig
   -            if (keep_at) |k| if (k == self.count - 1) {
   +            if (keep_at) |k| if (k == self.count) {
   ```
   The choices that lead there are all in `page_sim`: the budget, the
   sizes, and the order of operations (`put`, `get`, `wrote`). Once those
   are named choices, this is the cleanest steering target in the list.

2. **P5: a budget one byte short of a page multiple.** It is unreachable
   while `page_sim`'s budget is `intRangeAtMost(1, 12) * page`. If the budget
   becomes a named choice that includes `k * page - 1`, the
   `props.unreachable` "no room for a file within the budget" fires as soon
   as a file rounds to exactly `budget + 1`. The patch:
   ```diff
   --- a/src/page_cache.zig
   -        if (size > self.budget) {
   +        if (size > self.budget + 1) {
   ```
   This is a test of whether steering can open a choice blind seeds never
   make, so it needs the budget's alternatives widened first.

3. **T6 and S6 are not targets yet.** They are reached today, but nothing
   fails when they differ. They become targets once the oracles in the table
   above exist (`queue`'s room in `tcp_sim`, clusters after a failed
   `replace` in `store_sim`).

The unreached survivors (T3, T15, L7, P1, F10, S11) aren't on this list for
a different reason: no generator makes their state at all, so steering has
nothing to choose. Each needs its generator widened, as the table says.

## How it was run

The scripts are in CC's session, not this repo. For each mutant:
1. Replace the exact original text on its line, checking it occurs once.
2. Run `zig build test`. If it fails, the mutant is killed, and the failing
   test is named from the build summary.
3. If it passes, run the reduced `zig build properties` (timeout 1200 s).
4. Restore the file with `git checkout`, and check the tree is clean before
   the next mutant.

A mutant that failed to compile was recorded as stillborn and rewritten.
