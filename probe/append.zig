//! **THE APPEND.** Every write `angry-gopher` makes that is not a whole file is
//! this, and it is always spelled the same way:
//!
//!     var file = try Io.Dir.cwd().createFile(io, path, .{ .truncate = false });
//!     defer file.close(io);
//!     const st = try file.stat(io);
//!     try file.writePositionalAll(io, bytes, st.size);
//!
//! — a chat message, a game action, an uploaded chunk, a puzzle move. So this
//! probe writes through exactly that, not through `fat16` underneath it.
//!
//! **THE CASES ARE THE ONES THAT CAN ACTUALLY BREAK**, and each is a different
//! path through fat16.writeInto:
//!
//!   log.txt     600 fixed-width lines, appended one at a time. At 2 KB per
//!               cluster that is fourteen clusters, so the chain is extended
//!               thirteen times rather than once — and the probe ASSERTS that,
//!               because the first version of it wrote 1,692 bytes, fitted in a
//!               single cluster, and passed with the extension deleted.
//!   small.txt   Three appends of 1, 2 and 3 bytes. All inside one sector, so
//!               each write must READ that sector before writing it — a write
//!               that skipped the read would erase back to the boundary and
//!               leave "ccc" where "abbccc" belongs. This is the case a
//!               whole-sector writer passes every other test and fails.
//!   over.txt    An overwrite INSIDE the file: offset 3 of a 10-byte file. The
//!               bytes change, the size does not.
//!   (a hole)    offset past the end must be REFUSED. FAT has no sparse files,
//!               so the gap would be whatever those clusters last held, and
//!               answering with stale bytes is worse than failing.
//!
//! **THE VERDICT IS NOT THIS PROBE'S.** `probe/run.sh` hands the volume to
//! `fsck.vfat` and then mounts it with the Linux kernel's own VFAT driver and
//! regenerates the expected 600 lines in shell. Agreeing with our own reader
//! would prove very little — a size field and a cluster chain that disagree can
//! read back perfectly through the code that wrote them.
