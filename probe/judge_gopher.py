"""The verdict on probe/gopher.zig: the same request, answered twice.

    judge_gopher.py <gopher.elf> <linux zig-server binary> <angry-gopher root> <work dir>

**LINUX IS THE ORACLE.** The claim is that porting angry-gopher to a machine
with no operating system changes nothing about what it serves. So every request
below goes to two servers built from the same source:

  - the kernel, booted in QEMU with the site on a GPT disk whose first
    partition is FAT16 (FAT=32: FAT32) — one boot for all the single requests,
    or one each with JUDGE_ISOLATED=1; JUDGE_DROPLET=1 boots the droplet's
    machine instead, with chat's data on a SCSI volume;
  - the ordinary Linux build, run over a copy of the same files.

and the answers must agree: status, Location, Set-Cookie, Content-Type, and the
body byte for byte. /version is compared field by field, since it names the
build and reports live memory by design.

**EVERY CASE STARTS FROM THE SAME STATE ON BOTH SIDES** — a fresh copy of the
disk for the kernel, and a fresh copy of the files and a fresh server for
Linux — because several requests write, and a write on one side must not leak
into the next case's comparison.

**A WRITE IS JUDGED TWICE.** After it, the files it touched are read back —
off the kernel's disk (mtools, below), and straight off the Linux server's
directory — and must match, and the kernel's disk must pass fsck.

**TIME.** Routes that stamp the wall clock write a different second on each
side. A Unix time is replaced with <NOW> only if it lies inside the window in
which THAT side handled the request; a kernel whose clock was wrong would leave
a bare number, and the comparison would fail. Times staged into the fixture
(1758000000) are nowhere near either window, so pages that render them are
compared exactly — including the Eastern-time formatting.

The kernel's disk is populated and read with mtools, which needs no root
(QUEUE.md item 64). JUDGE_MOUNT=1 does it through Linux's vfat driver, a loop
mount, instead: another independent reader, which needs `sudo -n`, and without
it the whole check is SKIPPED (exit 77) and says so.

Exit 0 when every case agrees, 1 when any does not, 77 when it could not run.
