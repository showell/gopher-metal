//! **WHAT A RESTART KEEPS, MEASURED** (RESTART.md, QUEUE.md item 7).
//!
//! The machine restarts itself three ways in turn, and after each, on the
//! next boot, says whether it came back and what survived:
//!
//!   1. the reset control register, port 0xCF9 (PIIX3, as on a droplet);
//!   2. the keyboard controller's reset line (0xFE to port 0x64);
//!   3. a triple fault (an empty interrupt table, then an exception).
//!
//! A method that does not restart this machine is reported, and the next is
//! tried at once. It ends (PASS) once all three have been tried: which ones
//! worked is the result, read from the log, and differs by machine.
//!
//! What it looks for after each:
//!
//!   - **RAM past the kernel**: a record at `carry_address`, outside every
//!     segment the loader writes or zeroes, and outside the BIOS's memory;
//!   - **CMOS**: the byte at `cmos_stage`, which is also how this kernel knows
//!     which restart it is on. If CMOS did not survive a restart, the kernel
//!     starts over at the first method, and the run never ends: the judge's
//!     timeout says so.
//!
//! The record is checked, not trusted: a magic number, the boot count and a
//! checksum over both, so RAM full of 0xA5 (droplet.sh's DIRTY=1) reads as no
//! record rather than as one.
//!
//! **RUN IT WITHOUT `-no-reboot`.** With it, QEMU ends at the first restart,
//! which is how a judge sees that one happened, but this probe wants to see
//! the next boot.
