//! A kernel that gets a DHCP lease and says so.
//!
//! This is the network half of the same idea as the block probe: put the
//! driver on virtual hardware and find out whether it works before anything is
//! built on it. QEMU's user-mode networking runs a DHCP server at 10.0.2.2
//! with nothing configured, so a lease is a checkable result that needs no
//! second machine.
//!
//! It is also the same exchange Cobblestone's `dhcp-acquire` performs through
//! the Roc machine and an emulated NE2000. Two paths, one protocol, one answer
//! to compare.
