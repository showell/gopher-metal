//! Reading what Linux wrote.

//! The backup story has two halves and only one of them is `cp -r`. This is the
//! other: a volume written by the Linux kernel's own VFAT driver, with long

//! a backup taken on Linux can be restored here — which is the whole point of
//! the volume being a real filesystem rather than a private format.
