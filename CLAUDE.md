# Instructions for Claude

The README is the orientation. Work happens on the dev box, with Steve.

If you are a Claude Code **cloud** session ("CC"): you work here on the
**simulators and properties only** (since 2026-10-05), plus, since
2026-10-06, **the Store** (QUEUE items 76-81: its interface, model, FAT and
strict Linux implementations, and `store_sim`, all new files, none of them
in the image). Your charter, the
branch map and the one shared queue live in metal-vmm, not here: read
metal-vmm's `CLOUD_WORK.md` ("gopher-metal: the simulators") and its
`QUEUE.md` on `master` (github.com/showell/metal-vmm). Branch from
`master`, push only `claude/*` branches, and never push to `master` or a
`vN` tag: the box merges. What serves lynrummy.com is a tag (`v18` today),
not a branch.

**THE SIMULATORS ARE THERE TO KEEP THE LAYERS HONEST.** A simulator can only
drive code that is pure logic: no `io.zig`, no driver, no device, no clock but
the one it is handed. That is the point of them, not a limitation: every
simulator here is a reason for the code it drives to stay a layer that needs
nothing below it. So when a module you want to simulate reaches into I/O,
do not mock the I/O; propose the seam (the pure decision pulled out, the I/O
left behind) under "Proposed" in metal-vmm's QUEUE.md, and the box decides.
The kernel, the boot path, the drivers and deploys are the box's.
