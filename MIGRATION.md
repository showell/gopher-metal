# Moving prod's chat data onto a FAT volume

**The procedure is CUTOVER.md**, steps 2 to 5. This page is the background
to them: what a Linux folder can hold that a FAT volume cannot, which of
those the application itself can make, and what
`droplet/check_volume_tree.py` (step 3) looks for. Read it when the checker
finds something.

Prod's chat data is about 215 MB in about 800 files under `data/` and
`auth/`. It lives on Linux, whose filesystem allows almost anything in a
name or a tree. It moves onto a FAT32 volume that two different programs
handle:
- **`droplet/build_volume.py` writes it once**, with mtools, without root;
- **this machine's own `src/fat16.zig` and `src/io.zig`** read and write
  it from then on.

## Which FAT

**FAT32, at Steve's decision** (QUEUE.md, item 17): before the cutover, so
the data moves once. The reason is each user's lifetime cap of 1 GiB, not
today's size. FAT16 stops at 2 GiB; FAT32 is limited here by the FAT this
machine holds in memory, 32 MiB, which is 64 GiB at 32 KiB clusters
(`gopher.zig`'s `fat_budget_bytes`). This machine mounts both kinds, decided
by cluster count as the spec says, so a FAT16 volume keeps serving until
the FAT32 one is attached.

Every tool here says which format it makes or assumes:

| tool | FAT16 (the default) | FAT32 |
|---|---|---|
| `droplet/check_volume_tree.py` | a 512-entry root, a 2 GiB volume | `--fat 32 --gib N`: the root grows like any directory; the space estimate uses N |
| `droplet/build_volume.py` | 2 GiB | `--fat 32 --gib N`: the cutover's volume |
| `droplet/new_volume.py` (an empty volume) | 2 GiB | `--fat 32 --gib N`, N of 3 or more, 32 KiB clusters |
| `droplet/compare_volume.py`, `tools/fat16_read.py` | read either kind, decided by cluster count | the same |
| `probe/run.sh`, `probe/run.sh gopher` | the default | `FAT=32` |

The hazards below are the same on both kinds, except that FAT32's root has
no fixed limit of 512 entries.

## What the application can make

The application can produce exactly one of the hazards below: **names that
differ only in case**. It could also produce **names too long for
`fat16.zig`** until `max_name` went from 64 to 96 (QUEUE.md item 8). The
other hazards would have to come from something other than the application.

## What the application builds

From angry-gopher's own code (`roots.zig`, `chat_store.zig`, `users.zig`,
`player.zig`, `storage.zig`, `docs_store.zig`, `chat_upload.zig`,
`chat_state.zig`, `chat_links.zig`):

| part of a path | rule (from the validator) | where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| session id | `[A-Za-z0-9]+(-[A-Za-z0-9]+)*`, 1–80 chars, **either case**, chosen in the URL (`validSessionID`) | `sessions/<sid>.md`, `.count`, `.lastauthor`, `.reactions.jsonl`, `<sid>.uploads/` |
| channel name | a letter, then up to 39 of `[A-Za-z0-9-]`, **either case** (`validChannelName`) | `data/chat/channels/<name>/`, `<name>.channel` |
| doc slug | `[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*`, 1–80, lower case (`validDocSlug`) | `data/chat/users/<uid>/docs/<slug>.md` |
| upload | 16 random bytes in hex, `.` extension | `<sid>.uploads/<32 hex>.<ext>` |
| user, player, conversation | digits; `p<n>`; `<a>_<b>` | `auth/<id>/`, `data/players/<id>/`, `data/chat/<a>_<b>/` |
| fixed names | `_session_secret`, `next-id.txt`, `last-seen` (users and players), `upload-bytes`, `admin`, `api-key`, `password`, `name`, `code.md`, `images.md`, `last-conv` | |
| placed by hand | `links.md`: `chat_links.zig` reads it, and nothing in the application writes it | `data/chat/users/<uid>/links.md` |

Every name is ASCII from `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. No name ends in a dot or a space.
The deepest path is about 200 bytes and seven levels:
`data/chat/channels/<40>/sessions/<80>.uploads/<36>`.

## The hazards

### Names that differ only in case — **the application can produce these**

- **Linux** holds `Plan.md` and `plan.md` side by side.
- **FAT** does not: names are compared without case.
  - `shutil.copytree` onto a vfat mount opens the second name, finds the
    first, and writes over it. There is no error, and one session is gone.
  - This machine's `fat16.zig` also finds names without case (`eqlFold`).
- **The application can produce them.** Session ids keep their case and come
  from the URL, so two topics `Plan` and `plan` in one conversation are two
  sessions on Linux. Channel names are the same.

**This is a hazard after the migration too, not only during it.** On this
machine, creating session `plan` when `Plan` exists replaces it
(`writeFileIn` removes the old entry by name, without case, first). The
same request on Linux makes a second session. The fix belongs in the
application: Steve has decided on names without case, and the box is
making that change in angry-gopher. Until then, the checker says whether
prod has any (on 2026-10-02 it had none).

### Names too long for this machine — **the application could produce these, before `max_name` was 96**

- **Linux** allows 255 bytes. **VFAT** allows 255 UTF-16 characters, so the
  copy succeeds.
- **`fat16.zig` reads and writes names up to `max_name` = 96.** A longer
  name is refused on write, and on read is found only under its 8.3 alias
  (`SESSIO~1.JSO`), so the application cannot open it by name, and a
  listing shows the alias.
- **The application's longest name is 96 characters.**
  `<sid>.reactions.jsonl` is 16 characters longer than the session id, and
  a session id may be 80. A doc slug may be 80 too, making `<slug>.md` 83.
- **It was 64 until QUEUE.md item 8.** Then any session id over 48
  characters, or a doc slug over 61, made a name this machine could not
  hold. Kernels from before item 8 should not serve a migrated volume.
  Nor should kernels from before `d1c7364`, whose reader stopped at 52.

**What to do:** nothing, on a kernel with `max_name` = 96. The checker
still lists any name over 96 in prod's data, which only something other
than the application could have made.

**Paths and depth are fine:**

- `io.zig` opens paths up to 256 bytes; the application's deepest is about
  200.
- `fat16.zig`'s `removeTree` stops at 16 levels; the application's deepest
  tree is about 7.

The checker reports any path past either limit.

### Characters FAT forbids — the application cannot produce these

| what Linux allows | what happens | effect on this machine |
|---|---|---|
| `" * : < > ? \ \|` or a control character | VFAT refuses the name, so the copy fails with `EINVAL` | — |
| a name ending in `.` or a space | vfat drops the trailing dots and spaces, so `notes.` is stored as `notes`, and collides with `notes` if both exist | — |
| a character past ASCII | VFAT can store it (with `iocharset=utf8`) | `fat16.zig` reads it as `?` and cannot find the file by its name |

### Files over 4 GiB — the application cannot produce these

A FAT file's size is 32 bits, so a write past 4 GiB − 1 fails with `EFBIG`.
Caddy caps one upload at 110 MB, and the application caps a user at 1 GiB
in all.

### Timestamps outside 1980–2107 — the application cannot produce these

- **The range.** FAT dates run from 1980-01-01 to 2107-12-31. vfat clamps
  anything outside that, and `fat16.zig` writes "no date" for it. Every file
  the application writes carries a real modification time; a file from
  elsewhere (a `tar` with zero times, say) might not.
- **Two things change for every file**, and matter because chat's "recent"
  is ordered by modification time:
  - **resolution:** FAT keeps times in 2-second steps, so two writes in the
    same 2 seconds sort by name;
  - **time zone:** FAT stores local time, and this machine reads it as
    UTC. So the volume is written in UTC: `build_volume.py` runs mtools
    with `TZ=UTC`, and the judge's Linux mount uses `tz=UTC`. Written any
    other way, every time would shift by the host's offset, and
    `compare_volume.py` would say so.

### Symlinks, hard links and special files — the application cannot produce these

| on Linux | on FAT |
|---|---|
| symlink | FAT has none. `shutil.copytree` follows it: a link to a directory copies that tree again, and a dangling one fails the copy. |
| hard link | stored as separate copies, which no longer change together |
| pipe, socket or device | cannot be stored |

The application's `Io` has no call that makes any of these.

### Paths the application does not build — decide whether they move

Nothing is wrong with them on FAT, but something other than the application
wrote them, so they move only if someone decides they should. The checker
reports each such tree once, at its top (`not-the-apps`).

On prod, 2026-10-02, there were two kinds:

- **`data/chat/blog-comments/`**: the retired blog's comments (angry-gopher
  `9f91713c`, `246d82de`). Deleted from prod that day, with the deploy
  directory's old `blog/`, at Steve's direction; a copy is in
  `~/prod-archive/blog-2026-10-02.tgz` on the development box.
- **`data/users/r/` and `data/users/y/`**, one `last-seen` each, written
  2026-06-23 16:01 UTC, 14 seconds apart. That is the chunked-body identity
  bug: a user id read from request memory that the body read had just
  overwritten, fixed 41 minutes later (`e2610edd`). `touchUser` made a
  directory under whatever id it was handed.

**Run the checker on a real copy** (`rsync -a`, without `-H`), not on a
hard-linked view of prod's tree: every file in such a view has two names, and
each is reported as a hard link.

### How many entries a directory holds

- **The size of a name on disk.** An entry is 32 bytes. A name that is not
  upper-case 8.3, which is every name the application makes, takes one entry
  plus one more per 13 characters.
- **The root is a fixed run** of 512 entries (`mkfs.vfat`'s default). It
  holds `data` and `auth`, 4 entries in all.
- **Every other directory may grow to 65,536 entries** (2 MiB). Past that
  `fsck.fat` calls it broken, and `fat16.zig` stops there too: a write
  that needs more room fails, and the application answers it as a full
  disk. angry-gopher's Store header says how near each of its folders can
  come (REVIEW-fixed-sizes.md, finding 1).
- **The application's busiest directories:**
  - **a conversation's `sessions/`:** five names a session, about 4–8 entries
    each, so roughly 4,000 sessions in one conversation before the limit;
  - **a session's `<sid>.uploads/`:** 36-character names, 4 entries each, so
    about 16,000 uploads in one session;
  - **`auth/`:** one directory per account.
- **Speed matters long before the limit.** `fat16.zig` finds a name by
  reading its directory from the start, every time.

The checker reports, per directory, whether it is over its limit.

### Space on the volume

Every file and directory takes whole clusters: 32 KiB, on the FAT32
volume `build_volume.py --fat 32` makes, as on the 2 GiB FAT16 one the
test site uses. 800 files waste at most 800 × 32 KiB ≈ 26 MB.

The checker adds it up for the real tree, against `--gib N`. On prod,
2026-10-02: 835 files and 275 directories take 251 MB on the volume.

### What survives, changed

- **Owners and permissions are lost.** `password` and `api-key` are `0600` on
  Linux; on FAT every file belongs to whoever mounts it. That doesn't matter
  on this machine, which has no users. It does matter for the backup story:
  anyone who can mount the volume can read them.
- **Access and change times are lost**; only the modification time is kept,
  in 2-second steps.

## What the tools check

CUTOVER.md runs these in order; `droplet/rehearse.sh` runs them all on a
copy. What each one proves:
- **`check_volume_tree.py COPY --fat 32 --gib N`**: every hazard above,
  in the real tree. `--json` gives the same for a script. Fix or decide on
  each finding in the copy, and run it again until it finds nothing.
- **`build_volume.py COPY OUT.img --fat 32 --gib N`**: GPT, one
  partition, mkfs.vfat with 32 KiB clusters, then the tree copied in with
  mtools (`mcopy -s -m`, `TZ=UTC`), keeping modification times in UTC. It
  refuses a tree the checker still finds anything in. It then runs
  `fsck.fat -n`, `tools/fat16_read.py check` and `compare_volume.py`, and
  prints the FAT serial.
- **`compare_volume.py COPY OUT.img`**, which needs no root: it reads the
  volume through `tools/fat16_read.py`, an independent reader written
  from the FAT spec. For every file and directory in the copy:
  - the name exists, compared exactly, not by case;
  - the size and SHA-256 match;
  - the modification time is within 2 seconds, read as UTC.

  It also reports anything on the volume that is not in the copy. Its
  `--self-test` makes volumes with mkfs.vfat and mtools and checks that
  each kind of mismatch is found.
- **Booting this machine on the volume, and `compare_hosts.py`**: every
  page as Linux serves it from the same copy, then the same after writes.

## Rehearsed, 2026-10-02, on a copy of prod's data (FAT16)

On the development box, nothing on a droplet, angry-gopher `28702571` on both
hosts (the Store's first slice in it):

| step | result |
|---|---|
| 1. the copy | `rsync -a` of prod's `data/` and `auth/`, 2 s: 827 files, 266 directories, 215 MB |
| 2. check it | `check_volume_tree.py`: nothing but `data/users/r` and `data/users/y` (`not-the-apps`), since deleted from prod |
| 3. build the volume | `judge.build_disk(..., size=2 << 30)`, Linux's mount with `tz=UTC`, 3 s |
| 4. check the volume | `fsck.fat -n`: clean, 1,094 files, 7,641 of 65,493 clusters (250 MB); `tools/fat16_read.py check`: ok |
| 5. compare | `compare_volume.py`: "the volume holds the copy exactly" (names, sizes, SHA-256s, times) |
| 6. let this machine read it | booted on the droplet machine with the volume found by its serial; the same copy on Linux. Anonymous pages identical. As uid 1 (a session signed with the copy's own secret), **155 pages: 154 identical**: every conversation, every topic, its `raw` and `reactions`, recent, docs, links, images, code, settings, the admin and game rosters |

**The one difference is FAT's clock.** `/chat/recent` shows 7 sessions one
second earlier on metal: their last change fell on an odd second, and FAT
keeps modification times in 2-second steps ("What survives, changed").
After the cutover metal agrees with itself; only two sessions changed within
one 2-second window could ever trade places there.

## Rehearsed again, 2026-10-02 night, on FAT32 (`droplet/rehearse.sh`)

A fresh copy of prod's data, taken after angry-gopher `841c6b1d` was
deployed (signed cookies, game limits), on gopher-metal `aaba83b`. One
command, `rehearse.sh COPY --fat 32`, 2 min 16 s:

| step | result |
|---|---|
| check the copy | 826 files, 264 folders, nothing found |
| build the volume | 3 GiB FAT32 with mtools; `compare_volume`, `fat16_read` and `fsck.fat` agree |
| boot metal | the droplet machine under KVM, the volume by its serial, both disk checks clean |
| Linux | another copy, inside a network namespace, on its loopback only |
| compare, read-only | 540 pages, **540 identical** |
| compare, after writes on both hosts | 1,084 pages, **1,084 identical** |

The FAT16 run's one difference (recent's two-second clock) is gone: recent
now takes its times from the messages (QUEUE item 27).

**Not rehearsed yet:**
- the same build through Linux's own vfat driver (`--mount`): the first
  attempt was killed for memory, because the volume tools held the 3 GiB
  image whole (QUEUE item 75);
- writing the real DigitalOcean volume (CUTOVER.md, step 8).
