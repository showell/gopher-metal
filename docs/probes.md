# The probes, and what cost time

A probe is a kernel that is only a driver and a serial port (`probe/*.zig`,
one root file with a `kmain` each). They exist so a driver can be put on
virtual hardware and checked before anything is built on top of it.
`probe/run.sh` boots each under QEMU's `-M microvm` and maps QEMU's exit code
back to the guest's; `probe/run.sh <name>` boots one.

## What the probes check

**`block`** brings the device up, reads sector 0 and checks its boot
signature, then writes the last sector and reads all 512 bytes back. Reading
proves bytes moved; writing and comparing proves they moved **where we said**.

**`net`** brings the NIC up and takes a DHCP lease. QEMU's user-mode
networking answers DHCP at 10.0.2.2 with nothing configured, so the result
needs no second machine — and it is the same exchange Cobblestone's
`dhcp-acquire` performs through the Roc machine and an emulated NE2000. Two
paths, one protocol, one answer to compare.

**`http`** takes a lease, listens on port 80 and answers one request.
**Its verdict is not its own output** — QEMU forwards a host port to the
guest's 80, `run.sh` fetches from it, and what curl got back is what is
checked. The guest's console only says what it thought happened.

```
gopher-metal http probe
  address: 10.0.2.15
  listening on port 80
  request: GET / HTTP/1.1
  answered and closed
```

The rest: `stdhttp` (zig's own HTTP server, [port.md](port.md)), `stdio` (the
`Io.Dir` surface), `vfat`, `restore`, `append` and `replace`/`replace_cached`
([disk.md](disk.md)), `clock` and `realunset` (the TSC, the RTC, and refusing
a wall-clock read before the clock is set), `rng`, `memory`
([port.md](port.md)), `ladder` ([tcp.md](tcp.md)), `restart` and `backoff`
(the restart on failure, [RESTART.md](../RESTART.md)). A run looks like this
(an excerpt):

```
PASS block |   wrote and read back sector 65535: 512 bytes match
PASS stdio |   mutex: locked and unlocked twice, no contention possible
PASS vfat |   auth/damian: . .. api-key _session_secret
     vfat | fsck.vfat finds no error in what we wrote
     vfat | the Linux VFAT driver reads every name and byte we wrote
PASS restore |   auth/damian/_session_secret still reads: sixteen bytes!!!
PASS append |   createFile: .truncate = false keeps, the default empties
     append | fsck.vfat finds no error after 600 appends
     append | the Linux VFAT driver reads all 600 lines and the late append, byte for byte
PASS replace |   tree/: four levels with data, deleted whole
     replace | fsck.vfat finds nothing, and reclaims nothing
     replace | sessions/ is 7 clusters with 6 gap(s) and 2 straddling run(s); all 100 files read back byte for byte
PASS clock |   .real: the time it was told, advancing with .awake, re-anchored when told again
     clock | ok   unix 1789600584 is within the host's clock [1789600582, 1789600591]
     clock | ok   tsc_hz 2494162684 vs the host's 2494134000 (0.001%)
     clock | pinned to midnight, across a leap day: civil 2020-3-1 0:0:1, four formats agree
     clock | pinned to noon: civil 2020-3-1 12:0:1, four formats agree
     clock | pinned to 4 PM: civil 2020-3-1 16:0:1, four formats agree
PASS clock | refused as it must: the PIT would not calibrate the TSC
PASS realunset | refused as it must: PANIC: Io.Clock.now(.real) before setRealTime()
PASS rng |   over 4 KB: 16347 of 32768 bits set, commonest byte appears 25 times
PASS net |   server : 10.0.2.2
PASS http | curl got "hello from no Linux"
PASS stdhttp | curl got "hello from std.http.Server, with no Linux under it"
```

## Things that cost time

Written down because each one looks like something else.

**QEMU's multiboot loader refuses a 64-bit ELF** outright: *"Cannot load
x86-64 image, give a 32bit one."* PVH is the other door into the same
machine, takes an ELF of either width, and is what every modern microVM boots
anyway.

**`virtio-mmio` defaults to the LEGACY interface.** Every transport reads
version 1 until `-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false`, and a driver that
speaks virtio 1.2 correctly refuses to talk to it.

**microvm has 24 transports and fills them from the top.** A single
`-device virtio-blk-device` lands on bus 23 at 0xFEB02E00, with slots 0–7
present but empty — which is indistinguishable from "no device at all" if
you only scan eight of them. `info qtree` answers this in one command;
guessing does not.

**There is no port 0x61.** The textbook TSC calibration gates PIT channel 2
through the PC speaker's port and reads its output there; `microvm` has no
speaker, and the port reads 0xFF. Channel 0's count, latched and read back,
needs neither.

**A request sent while the guest is still starting takes six seconds.**
QEMU's user-mode network accepts the host connection at once and forwards the
SYN; a guest with no NIC driver running yet drops it, and QEMU's own TCP
retries only about six seconds later. `judge_gopher.py` waits for the guest to
print "listening" first.

**`-M microvm` leaves the CMOS clock out under KVM** unless asked
(`rtc=auto` means on under TCG, off under KVM, where microvm expects the guest
to use kvmclock). A port with nothing behind it reads 0xFF, and 0xFF in
register A has the update-in-progress bit set — so a missing chip looks
exactly like one forever mid-update. Every boot asks for `rtc=on,pit=on` by
name, and the kernel calls a 0xFF register A what it is: `NoChip`.

**A spin count is not a duration.** Under KVM a register read is two port
writes that exit to the emulator, so a spin costs thousands of times more than
under TCG, and "two billion spins, just over a second" becomes hours. The RTC
waits are durations of the calibrated timestamp counter; a missed edge reports
how many polls it made and what the seconds register said, and polls are a
quarter of a millisecond apart with nothing touched in between — how a real
chip wants to be treated, at the cost of that much anchor precision.

**Timing runs under KVM.** On microvm a boot asks for KVM only when it is
for timing (`judge_gopher.py`'s `start_kernel(kvm=True)`), because those
numbers are about speed and a deployed machine does not emulate its CPU; a
timing run that cannot get KVM fails rather than quietly measuring TCG under
its name. The correctness judges on microvm stay on TCG; the droplet-shaped
machine uses KVM whenever `/dev/kvm` is usable, as a droplet does.
